This guide provides the fastest way to get the project up and running for the hackathon. Follow these steps to quickly set up your development environment.

## Team Setup (4 Members)

### Team Member Roles

1. **Backend Developer**
   - Focus: Server APIs, Firebase setup, Database
   
2. **Android Developer**
   - Focus: Mobile app, UI implementation, QR scanning

3. **Full-stack Developer**
   - Focus: Hardware simulation, Integration, Testing

4. **UI/UX Designer**
   - Focus: App design, Admin panel, Animations

## 10-Minute Setup

### 1. Firebase Setup (Backend Developer)

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication with Email/Password method
3. Create Firestore Database in test mode
4. Download `google-services.json` for Android
5. Generate a Service Account Key for the server:
   - Go to Project Settings > Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate new private key"
   - Save as `serviceAccountKey.json`

### 2. Server Setup (Backend Developer)

1. Navigate to the server directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `serviceAccountKey.json` to the server directory
4. Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   API_KEY=any-random-string-for-hackathon
   PORT=5000
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
6. Test the server is running at: http://localhost:5000

### 3. Android Setup (Android Developer)

1. Open Android Studio and import the android project
2. Copy the `google-services.json` to the `app/` directory
3. Update the API URL in `Constants.kt`:
   ```kotlin
   const val BASE_API_URL = "http://10.0.2.2:5000" // For emulator
   // or
   const val BASE_API_URL = "http://your-computer-ip:5000" // For physical device
   ```
4. Build and run the project on an emulator or device

### 4. Admin Panel Setup (Full-stack Developer)

1. Navigate to the admin-panel directory
2. Update Firebase config in `js/firebase-config.js` with your Firebase project details
3. Serve the admin panel:
   ```bash
   # Using Python simple HTTP server
   python -m http.server 8080
   # Or using Node.js http-server
   npx http-server -p 8080
   ```
4. Access the admin panel at: http://localhost:8080

### 5. Testing the System (All Team Members)

1. **Create a Test Bin** (via Admin Panel)
   - Go to Smart Bins page
   - Click "Add New Bin"
   - Fill in the details and save

2. **Create a Test User** (via Mobile App)
   - Launch the app
   - Register a new account

3. **Generate a QR Code** (via Admin Panel)
   - Go to the Simulation page
   - Fill in the QR Generation form
   - Download the QR code

4. **Scan QR Code** (via Mobile App)
   - Log in to the app
   - Tap the scan button
   - Scan the QR code
   - Verify the points are awarded

5. **Create a Reward** (via Admin Panel)
   - Go to Rewards page
   - Add a new reward
   - Set point requirements

6. **Redeem a Reward** (via Mobile App)
   - Go to Rewards page in the app
   - Select the reward
   - Redeem it

## No-Hardware Simulation Guide

Since this is a hackathon project without physical hardware, use these simulation techniques:

### 1. Simulate Waste Deposit

#### Option 1: Admin Panel
1. Go to the Simulation page in the admin panel
2. Fill out the simulation form (user, bin, waste type, weight)
3. Click "Simulate Deposit"

#### Option 2: API Call
Make a POST request to `/api/simulate/deposit` with:
```json
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "binId": "bin123",
  "wasteType": "recyclable_plastic",
  "weight": 1.5
}
```
Include the header: `x-api-key: your-api-key`

### 2. QR Code Generation

1. In the admin panel, use the QR Code Generator to create bin-specific QR codes
2. Each QR code contains JSON with:
   ```json
   {
     "bin_id": "bin123",
     "waste_type": "recyclable_plastic",
     "weight": 1.5
   }
   ```
3. Use these QR codes for testing the mobile app

## Common Issues & Solutions

1. **App can't connect to the server**
   - Check that the IP address in `Constants.kt` is correct
   - Ensure the server is running
   - Check network settings if using a physical device

2. **Firebase Authentication fails**
   - Verify that Email/Password auth is enabled in Firebase console
   - Check that `google-services.json` is up to date

3. **QR code scanning doesn't work**
   - Ensure camera permissions are granted
   - Check that the QR code format matches what the app expects

4. **Points not updating**
   - Check the server logs for errors
   - Verify Firestore database permissions

## Demo Preparation

For your hackathon demo, prepare:

1. **Demo Flow**
   - Create a step-by-step demo script
   - Prepare test accounts and data in advance
   - Clear app data between test runs if needed

2. **Presentation Materials**
   - Screenshots of all app screens
   - Admin dashboard views
   - Database schema diagram
   - Architecture diagram

3. **Backup Plan**
   - Have pre-recorded demo video ready
   - Prepare screenshots of each step in case of technical issues

## Communication

Use Slack or Discord for team communication during development:
- Create separate channels for:
  - #general
  - #android-dev
  - #backend-dev
  - #ui-design
  - #testing

## Git Workflow

1. Create feature branches for each component:
   - `feature/login-screen`
   - `feature/qr-scanning`
   - `feature/reward-system`

2. Commit often with clear messages:
   ```
   feat: Add QR code scanning
   fix: Resolve points calculation issue
   style: Update home screen layout
   ```

3. Merge to `dev` branch for testing before merging to `main`

## Time-Saving Tips

1. **Use Mock Data**: Create realistic test data upfront
2. **Focus on Core Features**: Leave nice-to-have features for later
3. **Test Early**: Integrate components and test as you go
4. **UI Shortcuts**: Use built-in Material Design components
5. **Regular Sync-ups**: Brief 15-minute team meetings twice a day

Good luck with your hackathon! ðŸš€
